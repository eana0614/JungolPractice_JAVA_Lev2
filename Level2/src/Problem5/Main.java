/*
 * Problem 5. Domino 
 * 
 * There are N dominoes. Each domino is a rectangle and is divided above and bottom.
 * And numbers are written above part and bottom.
 * 
 * Write a program that print the max sum value of the two numbers.
 * The two numbers are sum of the above parts and sum of the bottom parts.
 * Example, if dominoes are [1,2] and [3, 4], 
 * 			number of cases the sum of above parts are 13, 31
 * 			and number of case the sum of bottom parts are 24, 42.
 * 
 *  Anyway, sort the dominoes and print max sum value.
 *  
 *  Input : N (number of dominoes, 1<= N <= 40), Domino Data 
 *  		>> written number range the dominoes = 0 ~ 9
 *  Output : Max value
 *
